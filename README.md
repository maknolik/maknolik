# Hi, my name is Maxim!
I graduated from Petrozavodsk State University and am currently studying as a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Systems. Data Management". I also take courses for neural network developers.

Here I publish my progress as a neural network developer, and maybe my own developments.

Among the applied skills I have studied, I highlight a good knowledge of **Python**, **C++** and **Dart**, as well as knowledge of working with databases like **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.
